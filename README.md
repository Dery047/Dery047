### 👋 Hi there, I'm Santiago Vergara

🎓 I'm a 4th-year Software Engineering student based in Colombia.  
💻 I specialize in backend development, with strong foundations in object-oriented programming, data structures, and relational databases.  
🛠️ My main stack is Python with Django and Django REST Framework, and I’m focused on building scalable and secure APIs.

🧠 Before diving into full backend development, I focused on mastering core CS concepts like programming logic, SQL, and data handling — which allows me to write cleaner, more efficient backend code.

⚙️ I’m also familiar with tools and workflows like Git, Postman, and GitHub for version control and testing.  
🌐 I’m exploring frontend tech like React.js to complement my backend projects and better understand full-stack architecture.

⚡ I enjoy coding late at night when everything is quiet — it's when I find my best focus and flow.  
🔥 I'm passionate about building practical solutions that solve real-world problems and learning from every challenge.
